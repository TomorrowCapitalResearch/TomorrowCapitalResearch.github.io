          <p>
            The trajectory of scientific progress has often been shaped by the
            deliberate pursuit of profound, unanswered questions. David Hilbert’s
            famous list of problems and, more recently, the Clay Mathematics
            Institute’s Millennium Prize Problems, concentrated intellectual effort
            on foundational hurdles and reshaped entire fields.
          </p>
          <p>
            The resolution of the Poincaré conjecture, first posed in 1904, is a
            canonical example: beyond solving a single puzzle, it stimulated decades
            of research and redefined the landscape of topology. These initiatives
            preserve the integrity of fundamental inquiry by setting clear, ambitious,
            technically rigorous targets.
          </p>
          <p>
            Financial markets, by contrast, are highly complex, non-stationary
            adaptive systems. Progress in quantitative finance cannot rely solely on
            incremental algorithmic improvements or isolated empirical “edges”.
            Genuine advancement requires confronting fundamental theoretical limits
            on:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Market microstructure and order-book dynamics</li>
            <li>Non-linearity, path dependence, and roughness</li>
            <li>Adversarial and competitive interactions between agents</li>
            <li>Informational efficiency, learning, and regime shifts</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Other domains, such as global health and climate, have successfully used
            “Grand Challenge” frameworks to align capital, talent, and institutions
            around their hardest problems. Quantitative and algorithmic finance still
            lacks a comparably coherent set of formally posed, foundational problems.
          </p>
          <p>
            Tomorrow’s Conjectures are our attempt to supply this. By framing a small
            number of central questions as formal conjectures, Tomorrow Capital
            Research (TCR) aims to distinguish verifiable intellectual breakthroughs
            from transient performance gains tied to specific regimes or datasets.
            The focus is on breakthroughs that yield provable computational or
            game-theoretic solutions, with clear paths to implementation.
          </p>
          <p>
            As quants, we also know that the pursuit of deep, grand problems—with the
            intention to understand and improve upon the structure of markets—is the
            driving force for many of us. Tomorrow’s Conjectures are intended as
            shared targets for that ambition.

            The semantic choice between “postulate” and “conjecture” is deliberate.
          </p>
          <p>
            A <strong>Postulate</strong> (or Axiom) is a fundamental assumption that
            defines the rules of a mathematical system and is accepted without proof.
            Non-Euclidean geometries, for example, arise by modifying a single
            Euclidean postulate. Such statements are not posed as challenges;
            accepting them as given would be counterproductive when our aim is to
            invite solutions.
          </p>
          <p>
            A <strong>Conjecture</strong>, by contrast, is a precise statement
            believed to be true (or false) but not yet proven. The purpose of
            Tomorrow’s Conjectures is precisely to invite the community to:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Produce a formal proof that resolves the conjecture and elevates it to
              the status of a theorem, or
            </li>
            <li>
              Provide a decisive counterexample or re-formulation, supported by
              algorithmic implementation and empirical validation.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            For each of the five conjectures, TCR intends to award successful
            resolutions with:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>A monetary prize</strong> (size to be announced)</li>
            <li>
              <strong>The Tomorrow Medal</strong>, our highest formal recognition for
              theoretical achievement
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Endorsement and amplification</strong> of the work as a landmark
              result, shared as widely as possible across academic and industry

          </ul>

            A successful submission must meet rigorous standards comparable to
            top-tier academic research in quantitative finance. Three components are
            required:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Formal mathematical statement.</strong> A rigorous proof
              demonstrating the existence, uniqueness, or key properties of the
              solution within a clearly defined model—or a decisive counterexample
              that falsifies or reformulates the conjecture.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Verifiable algorithm.</strong> A computationally tractable
              algorithm derived from the formal result, with sufficient detail for

              <strong>Comprehensive validation.</strong> Exhaustive testing against
              public and, where possible, blinded out-of-sample datasets using

                <h4>Challenge statement</h4>
                <p>
                  Design and formally validate a Market Regime Engine (MRE) that
                  optimizes a real-time Speed–Accuracy Trade-Off function, providing
                  the highest classification fidelity of latent market states
                  (volatility, trend, segmentation) subject to strict computational
                  latency constraints (e.g., microseconds–milliseconds).
                </p>

                <h4>Formalizing regime detection and the SAT constraint</h4>
                <p>
                  Market regimes represent persistent states of a financial market,
                  such as high-volatility episodes or sustained directional trends.
                  Accurately classifying these regimes is critical, as they
                  condition the relevance of factors and the expected performance of
                  trading strategies.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In practice, regime detection frequently relies on unsupervised or
                  semi-supervised methods, such as Hidden Markov Models, Gaussian
                  Mixture Models, or advanced clustering (e.g., Wasserstein
                  k-means). However, financial return series present challenges:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Heavy-tailed distributions and sensitivity to outliers</li>
                  <li>Temporal dependence and autocorrelation</li>
                  <li>Non-stationarity and regime transitions</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  A successful MRE must rigorously define the latent state space and
                  provide a classification method that jointly handles distributional
                  properties and temporal dependence. The defining constraint is the
                  speed–accuracy trade-off: complex models may improve theoretical
                  accuracy but introduce latency that renders decisions useless in
                  high-frequency contexts.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The conjecture seeks to maximize a generalized utility function
                  defined along an acceptable Speed–Accuracy Trade-Off curve, where
                  accuracy (e.g., F1-score, log-likelihood) is penalized by a
                  latency-dependent term that enforces a strict upper bound on
                  decision time. The optimal solution identifies the balance point

                <h4>Challenge statement</h4>
                <p>
                  Develop a generalized, tractable framework for convex portfolio
                  optimization under uncertainty that simultaneously incorporates
                  non-linear market frictions—specifically dynamic liquidation speed
                  capacity and factor-adjusted diversification—while achieving a
                  defined, stable return/risk profile.
                </p>

                <h4>Integrating constraints and frictions</h4>
                <p>
                  Classical Modern Portfolio Theory focuses on variance minimization
                  and typically ignores key real-world frictions: liquidity limits,
                  execution capacity, and factor concentration. Practical portfolio
                  construction must embed:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Position limits, leverage and budget constraints</li>
                  <li>Liquidity &amp; liquidation speed constraints</li>
                  <li>Factor and sector concentration controls</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Liquidation speed capacity</h4>
                <p>
                  Liquidation Speed Capacity models the relationship between
                  portfolio size, desired changes in asset weights, and available
                  market volume. For asset <em>i</em>, with average daily volume
                  <em>ADV<sub>i</sub></em>, the change in exposure over a
                  rebalancing window must respect a maximum participation rate
                  <em>λ<sub>max</sub></em>, ensuring that rebalancing does not
                  create undue market impact.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The conjecture requires solving for the maximum achievable,
                  <em>stable</em> return/risk ratio subject to a fixed, constrained
                  liquidation capacity, demonstrating resilience under liquidation
                  stress scenarios.
                </p>

                <h4>Factor-adjusted diversification</h4>
                <p>
                  Simple concentration metrics like the Herfindahl–Hirschman Index
                  (HHI) consider only position sizes. True diversification, however,
                  depends critically on the correlation structure between assets and
                  their exposure to common risk factors.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The conjecture mandates a generalized HHI that incorporates either
                  the asset covariance matrix or factor loadings, penalizing highly
                  correlated exposures more aggressively than uncorrelated ones. The
                  goal is to find weight vectors that satisfy:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    A target constrained return/risk profile, and
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    A provably optimal factor-adjusted diversification score, under
                    liquidity and participation constraints.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  The central challenge is preserving mathematical tractability
                  (e.g., convexity) in the presence of such non-linear frictions.

                  Derive the optimal order distribution strategy for large-volume
                  execution in a competitive market, framed as a game-theoretic
                  problem, where the strategy maximizes expected P&amp;L by
                  minimizing informational leakage and subsequent alpha decay induced
                  by competing agents.
                </p>

                <h4>Execution as a game</h4>
                <p>
                  Traditional optimal execution focuses on minimizing implementation
                  shortfall by balancing permanent and temporary impact against
                  holding risk. In modern electronic markets, this is insufficient:
                  other algorithmic participants actively observe and respond to
                  order flow.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The execution agent’s strategy must therefore be optimal not only
                  with respect to impact, but also with respect to strategic
                  detection and exploitation by other self-interested agents. This
                  places the problem squarely within algorithmic game theory, where
                  utility depends on both one’s own strategy and the distribution of
                  opponents’ strategies.
                </p>

                <h4>Modeling stealth and information leakage</h4>
                <p>
                  The conjecture requires a formal market model in which:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    The execution agent’s order flow generates signals observable to
                    competing algorithms.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Competing agents attempt to infer latent order intent and front-run
                    or otherwise exploit the detected pattern.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    The execution agent’s utility depends on implementation shortfall
                    and an explicit alpha decay term linked to detectability.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  The goal is to solve for a (possibly mixed) strategy that minimizes
                  implementation shortfall while maximizing time-to-detection or
                  minimizing detection probability, within a Nash or mean-field game
                  equilibrium framework.

                  Formulate a dynamic asset control policy that determines, at each
                  time step, whether an asset should be held (passive allocation) or
                  actively traded, based solely on objective time-series features of
                  its market microstructure—specifically market capitalization,
                  trading volume, and inferred ownership structure.

                <h4>The Hold vs. Trade decision boundary</h4>
                <p>
                  Dynamic Asset Allocation adjusts weights in response to evolving
                  conditions. The Dynamic Ownership Paradigm introduces a binary
                  decision for each asset:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Trade</strong>: trigger active rebalancing, incurring transaction costs</li>
                  <li><strong>Hold</strong>: maintain current weight, incurring only holding risk</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  The decision boundary must be defined purely by microstructure
                  variables, reflecting the trade-off between expected benefit of
                  active management and its cost, under realistic liquidity and
                  ownership conditions.
                </p>

                <h4>Microstructure inputs and ownership inference</h4>
                <p>
                  The optimal policy should use:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Market cap</strong> and <strong>trading volume</strong> as
                    proxies for liquidity and depth
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Inferred institutional ownership structure</strong> from

                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  Because ownership data is often delayed or incomplete, the solution
                  must provide a robust inference mechanism. Different ownership
                  regimes (e.g., institutional dominance vs. retail-driven flow)
                  imply different impact profiles and hence different thresholds for
                  when active trading is justified.

                  For any complex, partially observable, stochastic strategy game
                  involving many rational players, define and solve for a Pareto
                  optimal strategy set by proposing a three-part strategy framework
                  (Information, Actions, Goals) that robustly integrates communication
                  and alliance formation to achieve globally maximized utility, even
                  when individual goals conflict.

                <h4>The multi-agent strategy challenge</h4>
                <p>
                  AI research has progressed from two-player perfect information games
                  to multi-agent, partially observable environments such as StarCraft
                  II and Diplomacy. In such games, success is fundamentally about
                  coordinating beliefs, communication, and commitments, not merely
                  about selecting moves in isolation.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In financial analogues—large hedge funds and trading firms
                  competing for alpha—the highest collective outcome often lies on
                  the Pareto frontier, where no agent can improve their utility
                  without harming another. Yet, individual incentives and equilibrium
                  concepts like Nash often favor defection over cooperation.

                  <li>
                    <strong>Actions:</strong> both standard game actions and meta-actions

                  set in complex, multi-player strategy spaces. The algorithm must
                  demonstrate that rational, self-interested agents can systematically
                  coordinate to achieve outcomes that are strictly superior to Nash
                  equilibria in terms of global utility.

          <h4>Scientific Advisory Board</h4>
          <p>
            The long-term credibility of Tomorrow’s Conjectures depends on an
            uncompromising standard of adjudication, paralleling governance models
            used by institutions such as the Clay Mathematics Institute.
          </p>
          <p>
            Tomorrow Capital Research will establish a Scientific Advisory Board
            (SAB) composed of:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Leading academics in mathematics and computer science</li>
            <li>Researchers in quantitative finance and market microstructure</li>
            <li>
              Practitioners experienced in algorithmic trading, execution, and risk
              management
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The SAB is responsible for preserving the integrity and spirit of the
            conjectures, defining and updating award rules, and verifying that any
            claimed solution satisfies the stated standards.
          </p>

          <h4>Submission requirements</h4>
          <p>
            Submissions will be welcomed from university students, independent
            researchers, and quantitative professionals. Each submission must include:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              A research paper (e.g., 5–7 pages) summarizing the contribution,
              providing context, and clearly stating the main results.
            </li>
            <li>
              Complete technical documentation, including proofs, algorithms, and
              implementation details sufficient for independent reproduction.
            </li>
            <li>
              A clear separation between in-sample development results and final
              out-of-sample validation, with reproducible code and experiment logs
              where applicable.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h4>Scoring and validation criteria</h4>
          <p>
            Adjudication will weight scientific merit, innovation, and practical
            impact equally. A proposed scoring breakdown is:

            Tomorrow’s Conjectures are intended as a long-horizon, academically
            rigorous framework for directing future research in algorithmic finance.
            They are designed to attract not only quantitative finance specialists,
            but also researchers in computer science, game theory, and pure
            mathematics.
          </p>
          <p>
            The required outputs intentionally go beyond backtests and empirical
            heuristics, demanding generalized, provable strategies that remain valid
            under realistic frictions and competitive dynamics. In this sense,
            Tomorrow’s Conjectures are closer to the Millennium Prize Problems than to
            a trading competition.
          </p>
          <p>
            Final award of any prize money and conferment of the Tomorrow Medal will
            be conditional upon SAB verification that the solution meets the highest
            standards of proof, robustness, and reproducibility, and that it truly
            advances the theoretical framework of quantitative finance.
          </p>

            Details on formal submission procedures, timelines, and prize amounts will
            be published in a subsequent update. For expressions of interest or to be
            notified when submissions open, please contact Tomorrow Capital Research
